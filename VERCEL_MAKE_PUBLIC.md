## 🔒 If You Want to Keep It Protected

If you want to keep some protection but allow access:

- **Password Protection**: Set a simple password
- **Vercel Authentication**: Only Vercel users can access
- **Team Only**: Only your team members can access

But for a public app, disable all protection.

1. **Check Vercel Plan**:
   - Free tier should allow public deployments
   - Some enterprise features might restrict access

2. **Contact Vercel Support**:
   - If settings are missing, contact Vercel support
   - Or check Vercel documentation

3. **Alternative**: Create a new project:
