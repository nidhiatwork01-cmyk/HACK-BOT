# ✅ Step-by-Step: You're Halfway There!

## ✅ Step 1: DONE - Backend is Running!

Your backend is running on port 5000. **Keep this terminal open!**

---

## 🔄 Step 2: Start Frontend (NEW Terminal)

### In VS Code:
1. Look at your terminal panel
2. Click the **`+`** button (next to the terminal tabs) to open a NEW terminal
3. OR press **`Ctrl + Shift + `** (backtick key)

### In the NEW terminal, copy and paste this:

```bash
cd C:\AllMyProjects\hack-bot\frontend
npm run dev
```

### You should see:
```
  VITE v5.x.x  ready in xxx ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:3000/
```

---

## 🎯 Step 3: Open Browser

Once you see "Local: http://localhost:3000/" in the frontend terminal:

1. Open your browser
2. Go to: **http://localhost:3000**
3. You should see the Events Navigator homepage!

## 📊 What You Should Have Now:

```
Terminal 1 (Backend) ✅          Terminal 2 (Frontend) ⏳
┌──────────────────┐          ┌──────────────────┐
│ Running on       │          │ (Open new one!)   │
│ port 5000        │          │                   │
│ ✅ WORKING       │          │ npm run dev       │
└──────────────────┘          └──────────────────┘
```

---

## 🚨 Important:

- **DO NOT close Terminal 1** (backend)
- **DO NOT close Terminal 2** (frontend) once it starts
- Both must run at the same time!

---

## 🎉 Once Both Are Running:

Try creating an event - it should work now!
